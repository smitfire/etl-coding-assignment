# Design Decisions for Data Format Translation Program

This document explains the key design decisions made for the data format translation program, including the rationale behind each choice.

## 1. Modular Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with clear separation between parsers, transformers, and formatters.

**Rationale**:
- **Maintainability**: Each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
- **Extensibility**: New input formats or output formats can be added without changing existing code
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility

## 2. Common Data Model

**Decision**: Use a standardized internal data model to represent records.

**Rationale**:
- **Format Independence**: Decouples input parsing from output formatting
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent data handling regardless of source format
- **Simplification**: Reduces complexity by standardizing date and number formats
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript's type system for safer data handling

## 3. Library Selection

**Decision**: Use csv-parser for CSV parsing and fixed-width-parser for PRN parsing.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Both libraries are optimized for their specific formats
- **Streaming Support**: Both support Node.js streams for efficient processing
- **TypeScript Support**: Both provide good TypeScript type definitions
- **Community Support**: Both are well-maintained with good documentation
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keeps the project lightweight

## 4. Streaming Architecture

**Decision**: Use Node.js streams throughout the processing pipeline.

**Rationale**:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Processes data in chunks rather than loading entire files
- **Performance**: Allows parallel processing of different pipeline stages
- **Scalability**: Can handle large files without excessive memory usage
- **Standard Pattern**: Follows Node.js best practices for data processing

## 5. Strong Typing with TypeScript

**Decision**: Use TypeScript with strict type checking throughout the codebase.

**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Catches type-related errors at compile time
- **Self-Documentation**: Types serve as documentation for data structures
- **IDE Support**: Enables better autocomplete and refactoring support
- **Maintainability**: Makes the code more understandable and maintainable

## 6. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Implement unit, integration, and edge case tests.

**Rationale**:
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the program works as expected
- **Regression Prevention**: Prevents future changes from breaking existing functionality
- **Edge Case Handling**: Verifies correct behavior for unusual inputs
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior

## 7. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Implement robust error handling with informative error messages.

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Provides clear feedback when something goes wrong
- **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify and fix issues
- **Robustness**: Prevents crashes from unexpected inputs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Allows partial processing when possible

## 8. Command-Line Interface Design

**Decision**: Create a simple, intuitive CLI following UNIX principles.

**Rationale**:
- **Usability**: Makes the tool easy to use in command pipelines
- **Familiarity**: Follows established patterns for command-line tools
- **Flexibility**: Allows integration with other tools and scripts
- **Simplicity**: Minimizes learning curve for users

## 9. Data Transformation Approach

**Decision**: Normalize data during parsing rather than during formatting.

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent internal representation
- **Simplification**: Simplifies formatter logic
- **Reusability**: Allows reuse of transformation logic across different formatters
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes transformation logic in one place

## 10. Character Encoding Handling

**Decision**: Use UTF-8 encoding consistently throughout the program.

**Rationale**:
- **Universal Support**: UTF-8 is widely supported and can represent all characters
- **Compatibility**: Works well with both Node.js and web environments
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows modern best practices for text encoding
- **Requirement Fulfillment**: Meets the requirement to handle non-ASCII characters
